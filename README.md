# C++ Learning Repository

Welcome to my C++ learning journey! This repository contains code, notes, and examples as I learn and practice C++ programming.

## Goals
- Learn C++ basics and advanced topics
- Practice by writing small programs
- Update progress regularly



## How to Run
You can compile and run the code using any C++ compiler. For example, with g++:

```sh
g++ hello.cpp -o hello
./hello
```

## Updates
I will keep updating this repository as I learn new concepts and add more code examples.
